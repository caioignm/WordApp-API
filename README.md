# WordApp-API
WordApp-API is a small API designed to check how many times a word appears in each website provided. I built it with [Python3.6](https://github.com/python/cpython), [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and its extension [Flask-Restful](https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful) for studying purposes.
